  <p>  Over the summer break, me and my friend Manav decided to build a game to kill some time.
    He was interning and bobble head during that time.
    <br>
    Within a week, we were ready with the beta version.
      <br>
      <br>
      We secured the second postition when we submitted this for an interschool game development competition, and that is when we realised that we'd actually managed to build a decent game. We're still working on this project, but you can get the current version <a href = "http://microgiant.co/bobbleman/"> here. </a>
      <br>
      To add the game to your screen, use the add to homescreen option in your browser.
