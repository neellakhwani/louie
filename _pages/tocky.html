  <div class="blogtitle">Tocky : A ticking alarm clock.</div>
  <div class="blogsubtitle">9 May 2016</div>
  <div class="blogtxt">
  <p>I used to have a clock hanging in the hallway in my house. It was a large, circular clock, and if I ever studied late at night I would hear it ticking. I never thought much of it.
  <p>Fast forward a couple of years and I’ve since shifted homes, but maintained my nocturnal studying schedule. I don’t have that clock anymore, and I sometimes miss it when I’m trying to pull an all-nighter before an exam. It was a subtle reminder to keep working. Time is passing… are you?
  <p>I love my retro <a href="http://www.casio.com/products/Watches/Classic/A158WA-1">Casio A158W</a>, but I have to admit that clocks have been made redundant by mobile phones. We use phones to check the time, and to set alarms. But they don’t <i>tick!</i>

  <p>Tocky is a project that aims to fix that. <a href="http://gyanl.github.io/TockyClock">Open up Tocky</a> on your phone or computer, and you’ll be greeted with a friendly tick-tock sound that’ll keep you company while you work. You can even set an alarm and use the ticking to keep you focused till then.
  <p>Tocky was my first attempt at building a functional web app. It’s coded in HTML, CSS and Javascript. Check it out on <a href="https://github.com/gyanl/TockyClock">Github</a>!
